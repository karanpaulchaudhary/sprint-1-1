Hey brother ,I learned a new thing which is known as command line .Have you ever heard of un-manned aircraft ? its just like that.You can go to any folder of your computer without physically navigating to it.Many people avoid command line because of the black screen interface and because of the feeling that they are entering the world of star wars but practically its nothing like that.

10 Commands which are frequently used are as follow-
1.pwd- print working directory

2.mkdir-make directory

3.cd - change directory

4.cp - copy file or directory

5.pushd - push directory

6.popd - pop directory

7.ls - list directory

8.rmdir - remove directory

9.less - page through a file

10.cat - print whole file
